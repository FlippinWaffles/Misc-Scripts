# Misc Scripts

 Overview

 EmptyFolderSearch.bat - Searches for empty folders, will work on either a main folder (like Music > all your albums) or a larger setup (G: > all your music sorted alphabetically). The bigger the folder the slower it goes, the script would probably work better in powershell, python etc but meh it works! It took roughly 3 minutes for it to scan a 2.7 TB folder and produce a list of all the empty folders.
 
 MoveAllSubFolderFilesAndDelete.ps1 - This is only dangerous because it deletes. This script does exactly as it claims, if you put this in a folder with other subfolders it will move everything from the subfolders into the parent folder and delete all the subfolders. This works great when downloading 1 series and it has multiple folders (magazines, ebooks, etc)

Powershell to output.ps1 - This makes a list of all the folders names in a text document, great for doing updates on an archive or other misc projects.
